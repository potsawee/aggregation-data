# Aggregation Data: LLM Inference Run
- `llm_judge_{task}.py`: the script to run inference. I call it llm_judge as I set the evaluation prompt following LLM-as-a-judge (except MMLU), but technically it can be any inference task.
- `run*.sh`: example of the actual commands to call the python scripts
